# Eratosthenes-Sieve
This contains the Sieve of Eratosthenes in C language. 
How Sieve of Eratosthenes works: Let's say we want to find all primes between 1 and n. In this code, first prime is taken 
i.e., 2 and all occurrences of 2 except the first occurrence is deleted. Now, the next number is taken i.e., 3 and all occurrences
of 3 except first occurrence is deleted and so on for all non deleted numbers before n/2 (As n/2 is n's biggest divisor).
The final list of all non deleted numbers form all primes in the range.
